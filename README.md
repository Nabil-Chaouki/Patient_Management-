# Patient_Management 
Patient_Management is an WEB-Application Created with .net core 5 and Entity Framework Core and Sql server.
This Applicaion is a Practice for me to Develop Myn skills in c# and in Front languages like Angular and in he future Azure services.
It's a Simple Project to Manage Medical Patient due the lack of the management in cliniques and I hope that the Azure cloud surfaces with give an hole new experience to the User-Experience.
In version 1.0 I'm only gonna Work on Doctor/Assistant as User's After that I will make another verison including Patient as User's and creating a Link between the doctor and his patient.
